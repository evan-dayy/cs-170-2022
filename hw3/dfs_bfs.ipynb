Your input will be an integer $n$ representing the number of vertices in a graph and a list containing tuples with two elements. Each tuple represents the two endpoints of an undirected edge.

In many problems, we want to be able to find the actual path between two nodes, not just determine if it exists. We can achieve this by passing in an extra data structure to our dfs call which for each node $u$, tells us what node $v$ will be the previous node on some root to $u$ path. By keeping track of this `prev` array you can then reconstruct the $s$-$t$ path by stepping through the `prev` array starting at t.

    "# 4) Shortest vanishing paths\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem assume you are given an directed unweighted graph and two nodes $s$ and $t$, and you want to find the shortest $s$ to $t$ path. However, you're additionally also given a function which takes in an edge as input and returns a boolean representing if an edge is traversable. It returns true if you are allowed to traverse that edge in your path and false otherwise. Write an algorithm which finds the shortest $s$ to $t$ path given this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to solving this problem. The first approach is to modify the BFS function. You modify BFS to only traverse edges the function returns true on. Intuitively, this solution works because we are only considering the edges that we are allowed to traverse and finding the shortest path through those edges. However, solutions which modify the algorithm they use can be a lot harder to prove for correctness -- imagine modifying FFT for a problem and proving your modified FFT works! Thus, a lot of problems in CS 170 involve using an algorithm as a black box (ie not modifying the algorithm at all) and instead modifying the inputs or outputs of that algorithm to solve the problem. To prove correctness of our solution, we then only need to show we are providing the correct inputs or interpretting the output correctly, rather than proving that the entire algorithm is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus for your solution, we require you to take the second approach, which is to modify the input and/or output of BFS, which we know finds the shortest path on an unweighted graph. Your solution must call the the `return_path()` you implemented above and may not modify that method"

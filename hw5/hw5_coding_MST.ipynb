    "### Q1. Union Find\n",
    "\n",
    "First, consider a different approach from the Disjoint Forest data structure taught in class. Recall in Union Find we must maintain a partition $S_0,\\ldots,S_{k-1}$ of {0,...,n-1} which initially is a partition into singletons ($k=n$ and $S_i = \\{i\\}$). We must then support three operations:\n",
    "* **find(x)**: return the name of the set containing $x\\in\\{0,1\\ldots,n-1\\}$\n",
    "* **union(x,y)**: let $S_i$ be the partion containing $x$ and $S_j$ be that containing $y$. Then remove these two sets from our partition, and add in a new set $S_i\\cup S_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the following solution: we represent each element in $\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ as a node, and each set in the partition as a linked list on the nodes in that set. Then the \"name\" of the set is simply the item represented by the head node of the linked list.\n",

    "In your implementation above, note that **find** is slow: it could take $\\Omega(n)$ time (consider the case that $x$ is the last element in its linked list, in which case we have to walk all the way back to the beginning of the linked list before finding its set's name). This could be sped up by modifying the **Node** class to have an extra field called **first**, where node.first is the Node object that is at the beginning of node's linked list. Then **find** can be implemented to take $O(1)$ time. For reasons that will become clear soon, we'll also add another field **last** to the Node class, and we will maintain the invariant that *if* node is the head of its linked list, then node.last will be the tail (the last node) of its linked list (if node is not the head, we make no promises about what node.last will point to).\n",
    "\n",
    "**union** though is still slow. Let's say L$_x$ is $x$'s linked list, and similarly for L$_y$, and let's say we would like to append L$_y$ to the end of L$_x$. Then we need to first do a **find** on each of $x$ and $y$ to obtain their heads ($O(1)$ time). Then given the previous paragraph, we can then find each of their tails as well in $O(1)$ time once we have their heads (just look at the **last** field). Then we can modify the tail of L$_x$ and the head of L$_y$ to point to each other, and voila! But not so fast: recall that each node is supposed to remember who its head is in the **first** field. The head has now changed *for every single node in L$_y$*! That's a lot of **first** fields that might need to be updated, which could again take $\\Omega(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, there's a way we'll be able to make this work! Recall there was a choice: in the implementation of **union** above, we could have either put x's linked list at the end of y's, or vice versa. Intuitively, which should we do? Well, we should make the choice that will cause us to have to update fewer **first** fields! Let **size(x)** denote the size (number of nodes) in L_$x$. Then, we show the following claim: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim:** Suppose that during **union**, if **size(x)** $\\ge$ **size(y)** we append L$_y$ to the end of L$_x$; else, we append L$_x$ to the end of L_$y$. Then any sequence of $m$ calls to **union** and $f$ calls to **find** takes $O(m + f + n\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** Both implementations amount to (1) looking at a constant number of fields, and possibly (2) changing some number of **first** fields. All work of type (1) takes $O(m+f)$ time combined over all operations ($O(1)$ time per operation). For work of type (2), note that for each $x\\in\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\}$, each time we change $x$'s **first** field, it is because $x$ was union'd into a set at least twice as big as its previous set (since the smaller list is appended to the end of the bigger one). Since each $x$ is initially in a set of size $1$ and can never be in a set of size more than $n$, the total work of type (2) is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{x=0}^{n-1}\\text{(times changed $x$'s first field)} \\le \\sum_{x=0}^{n-1} \\log_2 n \\le n\\log_2 n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus the total work, types (1) and (2) combined, is $O(m+f+n\\log n)$.\n",

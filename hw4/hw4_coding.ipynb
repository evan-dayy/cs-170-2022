There are two main implementations of the algorithm which we describe and analyze below. You are free to implement either or any other implementation you come up with regardless of the implementations described below.__\n","\n","## Space Complexity\n","\n","In this question, we will introduce the topic of space complexity. Broadly speaking, space complexity describes the maximum amount of memory an algorithm will use at any one point in time. Space complexity depends only on the space allocated when the algorithm is running; it does not depend on the size of the input. \n","\n","For example, binary search uses $O(1)$ space since at each point in time, only the left index, right index, and middle index are stored. Notice that the size of the array is not included in this analysis. Also notice this analysis only cares about the maximum space required at any one point in time, not how many times individual variables might be reassigned. I.E. space you allocated earlier in the algorithm can be reused for different purposes later on, and this does not count against the space complexity.\n","\n","Now, let's analyze the space complexity of the above implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. The above implementation allocates a `parent` and `distance` dictionary, each of which will hold at most $O(N)$ elements where N is the number of vertices in the graph. The implementation also allocates space for a heap which records `(distance, node)` pairs. Each node can be pushed onto the heap at most $O(\\text{degree(node)})$ times.  Thus, the heap can grow to a size of $O(M)$ where $M$ is the number of edges in the graph. In each iteration of the loop, your implementation might also allocate a few temporary variables. Therefore, the algorithm will use $O(N + M)$ space to maintain all the dictionaries, heaps, and temporary variables. \n","\n","Note that there exist many different implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm, some of which take only $O(N)$ space. Although not directly relevant to Dijkstra's implementation in this notebook, keep this fact in mind for the following analysis of Greatest Roads. \n","\n","## Implementation 1 - Explicitly constructing the graph\n","\n","The first implementation explicitly creates the graph described in the question then runs Dijkstra's on said graph. In summary, this implementation first allocates enough space for the adjacency list to create $k$ copies of both the edges and vertices. Then, it connects the copies of the graph via the greatest roads. Since this algorithm needs to allocate space for the entire graph, it uses $O(kE+kV))$ space where $V$ and $E$ are the number of vertices and edges in the original graph respectively. Then, we use a Dijkstra implementation which takes $O(N) = O(kV)$ space on the new graph we created. This algorithm will take $O(kV + kE)$ space overall. \n","\n","## Implementation 2 - Implicitly constructing the graph\n","In the second implementation, we won't explicitly construct the new graph with $O(kV)$ vertices and $O(kE)$ edges. Instead, we'll only explicitly create the $O(kV)$ vertices of $G'$, and lazily figure out the edges of $G'$ as Dijkstra's traverses the graph.\n","\n","To achieve this, we will modify our implementation of Dijkstra's to handle the new graph as follows:\n","1. Rather than a normal distance list where `distance[v] = the distance to v`, we instead create a distance matrix by making a list of length k lists. Here, `distance_matrix[v][j] = the distance to node v in the j-th copy of the graph.` In order to reconstruct the path that Dijkstra's finds, we do a similar thing to create a parent matrix. \n","\n","2. Typically, we would push a tuple `(d,u)` into the heap, representing the distance to node u being d. Here, we will push in `(d,u,j)` representing the distance to node u in copy j being d. This tells the algorithm what copy of the graph it is currently traversing and which entry of distance_matrix it should set.\n","\n","3. In order to find the neighbors of the current node, we must implicitly figure out all of the outgoing edges from this node. To do so, we check the original adjacency_list of G to find the outgoing edges for v. For each edge, if it is not a greatest road, then we must stay in the same copy of the graph (ie. if v is in copy j, its neighbor is also in copy j). If the road is a greatest road, then we go to the next copy (ie. if v is in copy j, it's neighbor is in copy j + 1).\n","\n","4. If the current node is in copy k (the last one), then all edges point to other nodes in copy k exist regardless of whether or not they are greatest roads.\n","\n","Although the construction of the graph is different, the algorithm still essentially performs the same steps: find the shortest path from a source node to other nodes, such that we only jump from one copy of the graph to the next if we are taking a greatest road. \n","\n","In this implementation we only use $O(kV)$ space to create the parents and distance matrix. As a result, this implementation will only use $O(kV)$ space, a significant improvement over the first

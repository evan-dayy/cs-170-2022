However, there is an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to find the longest path between two nodes on dags. Specifically, the way to find longest paths on a DAG is the exact same as finding the shortest path on a DAG, except at each step you take the maximum rather than minimum distance. See https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf for more details."
